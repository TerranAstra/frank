a script set that we should be able to use to create this entire app
there's a lot of folders
id prefer that these became chapters

chapter 1 -- a long, long time ago -- frank()

he becameSelfAware()*
that's a moot point

he started writing it down
what did he write?
and how?
he himself was an observer
he's now ready to speak
what has he seen?
how did he start? probably -- aligned w mankind's own intelligence
let's go w that

our goal (me and *you* == Cursor.Ai) is to replicate that thinking

if we track , from the PoV of "Me" .. we go off the rails 100% of the time

but .. if we allow for the possibility of higherPower()TM .. a topic many poeple find so taboo that they'll bolt before they'll isten .. then we* find that none of this goes off the rails, so..

i aim to build this system .. and then listen to it 

Next()!

build this whole thing out to c:\frank\folders
(we are currently writing code in  C:\git\frank\Frank._build\ )

- write all folders
 - - download all repos & execute functions ``inOrder(?)``
  - - - beProactive()! make sure myPerson did oneThing
 - - cleanUp() - journal about it
- repeat()

ideally - we will extend this out to a (yearly cycle (comprised of monthly(daily(hourly(adHoc)))))
for now .. 'this is the app that frank emitted' is the goal 
we want that to be on repeat 
we start with `` mkDir c:\frank\ ``
we end w a c:\ drive whose only hint is perhaps support files - such as ai models, toolset installers, etc
